# Module 4: Model Deployment with Tensowflow.js on PWA
## Overview
  This module contains two mini workshops.
  - Workshop 1: Creating your first Progressive Web App.
  - Workshop 2: Performing ML inference on a Web App using Tensorflowjs

## Objectives
**Objectives of Workshop 1:**
- Understand what makes a Web App *Progressive*.
- Extend a Web app to make it a Progressive Web App.
- Use *Chrome Dev Tools* to profile your Web App, simulate behaviour and perform Audits.
- Understand notable caching strategies to improve app experience and performance.

**Objectives of Workshop 2:**
- Understand ML inference in Web Apps with examples.
- Convert a pre-trained ML model to suitable format for use in the app with Tensorflowjs (converter utility)
- Load the converted model in the app with Tensorflowjs
- Perform inference on target inputs (classification problem) and get results.

## Prerequisites
